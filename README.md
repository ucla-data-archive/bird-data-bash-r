# Reducing the Size of Bird Data 

Bird data notebook for the Library Grand Tour. Note b/c of the size of the original data set `ebd_US-CA-037_195001_201902_relJan-2019.txt`
you will not be able to perform the bash commands with just the code. If you are interested in finding more about how this works contact 
Tim Dennis <https://calendly.com/timdennis>. 

You can access the RMarkdown document converted to html here: <https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/bird-data-bash-r/bird.html>. I use bash and R in this document to reduce the size of the dataset and plot in R.
